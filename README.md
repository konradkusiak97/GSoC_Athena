Matrix multiplication:

```
[konradd-Flow@fedora matrix_mul]$ make all
dpcpp -std=c++17 -g -o matrix_mul_dpc src/matrix_mul_dpcpp.cpp 
[konradd-Flow@fedora matrix_mul]$ ls

Makefile     matrix_mul_dpc  matrix_mul.sln            sample.json  third-party-programs.txt
[konradd-Flow@fedora matrix_mul]$ ./matrix_mul_dpc 
Device: AMD Ryzen 7 5800HS with Radeon Graphics         
Problem size: c(150,600) = a(150,300) * b(300,600)
Result of matrix multiplication using DPC++: Success - The results are correct!
```

## Exercise 2

Since I have a local access only to an `AMD Ryzen cpu` and a `NVIDIA graphics card`, I will compare running the code on those two, using Intel's open source [llvm compiler](https://github.com/intel/llvm) for the `NVIDIA card`.

 - Matrix multiplication with `m_size = 1500 * 8` using `cpu_selector{}`:

 ```
[konradd-Flow@fedora matrix_mul]$ multitime ./matrix_mul_dpc
Device: AMD Ryzen 7 5800HS with Radeon Graphics         
Problem size: c(1500,6000) = a(1500,3000) * b(3000,6000)
Result of matrix multiplication using DPC++: Success - The results are correct!
===> multitime results

```

- Compiling and running the same code for NVIDIA card using `gpu_selector{}`:

```
From the `real` time, an initial conclusion can be drawn, that both on the CPU (multicore) and on the GPU, the code runs for a similar amount of time. This hints on the fact that the implementation could be improved for the GPU, because in cases such as matrix multiplication which are very much parallelizable, GPUs should give better results. The higher `user` time on the CPU variant is the effect of the code running on multiple cores - the `user` time is the sum of those. The higher `sys` time while running on the GPU is probably due to memory copying from the host to the device.

## Exercise 3 & 4

The code for the exercise 3 can be found in the corresponding directory: `Exercise3`.
I did the Vtune profiling by running the bilinear quadratic form implementation in Intel's devcloud, in order to have access to Intel's hardware. I run two types of analysis:
- gpu hotspots
- cpu hotspots.

The device that the code was run on, was `Intel HD Graphics P630`.

From the `cpu hotspots` it can be seen that the cpu implementation of the algorithm takes a fraction of time of the device's kernel execution. This could be due to the current size of the problem. Moreover, apart from the kernel execution itself, the memory copying also takes some time (the results back to the host):
![](Images/hotspots.png)

When we look at the specific `gpu hotspots` analysis, it seems that the kernel is not doing bad. It's active 90% of the time and also the `Local Memory` seems to be heavily used by `sycl reduction` technique from SYCL 2020. Since this feature was used, we can assume that the standalone reduction part inside the kernel is as optimized as it can be. Therefore, other parts of the code should be taken into consideration in further optimization. This would include: 
- looking at the memory allocations and possibly switching to explicitly moving the memory to the device,
- inspecting the sizes of work groups and checking if higher ones could improve the performance
- checking if GPU's performance will dominate over the CPU with higher problem size.
